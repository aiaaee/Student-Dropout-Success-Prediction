## Student Dropout/Graduate/Enrolled Prediction 

### About Dataset
This dataset originates from a Portuguese higher education institution and was developed as part of a national project aiming to combat student dropout and academic failure in universities. It brings together rich information from 4,424 undergraduate students across 8 degree programs, such as Agronomy, Design, Education, Nursing, Journalism, Management, Social Service, and Technologies.

### Objective
The core objective is to support early intervention by using machine learning models to predict a student’s academic outcome—whether they will:
`Drop out`
`Remain Enrolled`
`Successfully Graduate`
This is framed as a three-class classification problem with a known class imbalance, offering real-world challenges for predictive modeling and education analytics.
